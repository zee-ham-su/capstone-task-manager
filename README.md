## üß† AI Integration Strategy

### Code Generation
- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Scaffold component structures
  - Generate CRUD operations
  - Write utility functions
  - Create type definitions
  - Implement form validation logic

### Testing Strategy
- **Copilot for Test Generation**
  - Generate test cases based on component specifications
  - Create test scenarios for API endpoints
  - Write integration test templates
  - Generate mock data structures

### Documentation
- **AI-Assisted Documentation**
  - Auto-generate JSDoc comments for functions
  - Create and maintain API documentation
  - Update README files with new features
  - Generate changelog entries

### Context-Aware Development
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Feed repository structure to AI for context-aware suggestions
   - Use diff information for targeted code improvements
   - Analyze dependencies for optimization recommendations

2. **API Integration**
   - Generate TypeScript interfaces from API specs
   - Create OpenAPI documentation
   - Validate API implementations against specifications

3. **Code Review**
   - Automated code quality checks
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Performance optimization suggestions

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - Track AI suggestions effectiveness
   - Refine prompts based on outcomes
   - Build a custom knowledge base for project-specific patterns

## ü§ñ AI Tools and Contexts

### Development Tools
- **GitHub Copilot**
  - Integrated directly in VS Code
  - Used for code completion and generation
  - Context: Entire codebase, current file, and related files

- **VS Code AI Tools**
  - Code explanations
  - Refactoring suggestions
  - Debugging assistance

### Context Management
1. **File Context**
   - Current file being edited
   - Related component files (e.g., .tsx and .test.tsx pairs)
   - Imported modules and their types

2. **Project Context**
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - Component hierarchy
   - State management patterns
   - API service definitions

3. **Task Context**
   - Current feature/branch being developed
   - Related GitHub issues/PRs
   - Recent changes in the codebase

### Best Practices
1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Be specific about the desired outcome
   - Include relevant code context
   - Specify the programming language and framework
   - Mention any constraints or requirements

2. **Code Review**
   - Always review AI-generated code
   - Verify security implications
   - Check for performance optimizations
   - Ensure consistency with project patterns

3. **Documentation**
   - Document AI-assisted sections
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep track of AI-generated code patterns

### Limitations and Considerations
- **Context Window**: Be aware of token limits when providing context
- **Accuracy**: Verify all AI suggestions before committing
- **Security**: Never include sensitive information in prompts
- **Performance**: Be mindful of potential performance impacts of AI-generated code
